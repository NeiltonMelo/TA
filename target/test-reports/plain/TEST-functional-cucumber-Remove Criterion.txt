#Arthur Lapprand
Feature: Remove Criterion
  As the teacher
  I want to remove a Criterion from the system
  So that Criterion is not affecting student average anymore

  #GUI Scenario
  Scenario: Remove a criterion with students and evaluations using it                   # RemoveCriterion.feature:9
    Given a student with name "Zeca" and login "zc" is already on the system            # RemoveCriterionSteps.groovy:25
    And this student has an evaluation in criterion "TEORICA"                           # RemoveCriterionSteps.groovy:33
    When I remove the criterion "TEORICA"                                               # RemoveCriterionSteps.groovy:45
    Then I should not see the criterion "TEORICA" listed in the student with login "zc" # RemoveCriterionSteps.groovy:54

  #Controller Scenario
  Scenario: Remove a criterion from the system                                                                    # RemoveCriterion.feature:16
    Given the system has a student with name "Jose" and login "jj"                                                # RemoveCriterionSteps.groovy:67
    And that student has a "MA" evaluation in criterion "GDI" with origin "Test" and applicationDate "21/12/1992" # RemoveCriterionSteps.groovy:74
    When I remove the criterion "GDI" from the student "Jose" with login "jj"                                     # RemoveCriterionSteps.groovy:81
    Then the system correctly removes the criterion                                                               # RemoveCriterionSteps.groovy:88
