Feature: AddEvaluation
  As a teacher
  I want to evaluate each student by criteria
  to show them their progress in class

--Output from Add evaluation to a criteria--
--Output from Add evaluations using incomplete data--
  Scenario: Add evaluation to a criteria                                                                                      # AddEvaluation.feature:6
    Given there are no evaluations to all students to the "X" criterion, originated from a "Test" and dated from "28/03/2016" # AddEvaluation.groovy:95
    When I want to evaluate all students to the "X" criterion, originated from a "Test" and dated from "28/03/2016".          # AddEvaluation.groovy:103
    Then all the evaluations will be stored in on the "X" criterion history of each student                                   # AddEvaluation.groovy:112

--Output from Add evaluation more than once with same origin--
  Scenario: Add evaluations using incomplete data                                                                      # AddEvaluation.feature:11
    Given there are no evaluations to all students to the "Y" criterion,                                               # AddEvaluation.groovy:117
    When I want to evaluate all students to a the "Y" criteria, without a specific origin and dated from "28/03/2016". # AddEvaluation.groovy:125
    Then all evaluations will not be stored in on the "Y" criterion history of each student                            # AddEvaluation.groovy:130

  Scenario: Add evaluation more than once with same origin                                                                                # AddEvaluation.feature:16
    Given evaluations for every student on the "X" criteria, originated from "Test" and dated from "28/03/2016" are already in the system # AddEvaluation.groovy:134
    When I want to add a mark to all students to a the "X" criteria, originated from "Test" and dated from "28/03/2016"                   # AddEvaluation.groovy:142
    Then all the marks will not be stored in on the "X" criteria's history of each student                                                # AddEvaluation.groovy:148
