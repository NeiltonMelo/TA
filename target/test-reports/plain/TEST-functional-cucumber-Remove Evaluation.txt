Feature: Remove Evaluation
  As the teacher
  I want to remove an Evaluation from a Student
  So I can correct the Student overall evaluation

--Output from Remove evaluations in different criterion from a student--
--Output from Remove an Evaluation from a Student--
  #GUI Scenario
  Scenario: Remove evaluations in different criterion from a student            # RemoveEvaluation.feature:9
    Given the system already has a student with name "Student 1" and login "s1" # RemoveEvaluationSteps.groovy:25
    And this student has "MA" evaluation in criterion "SI"                      # RemoveEvaluationSteps.groovy:34
      java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot invoke method click() on null object
      	at pages.AddEvaluationPage.chooseValue(AddEvaluationPage.groovy:28)
      	at pages.AddEvaluationPage$chooseValue$1.call(Unknown Source)
      	at steps.RemoveEvaluationSteps.addEvaluationToCriterion(RemoveEvaluationSteps.groovy:61)
      	at ✽.And this student has "MA" evaluation in criterion "SI"(RemoveEvaluation.feature:11)

    And has a "MANA" evaluation in criterion "PLC"                              # RemoveEvaluationSteps.groovy:47
    When I remove the evaluation "MA"                                           # RemoveEvaluationSteps.groovy:67
    Then I should not see it listed in the student                              # RemoveEvaluationSteps.groovy:81

  #Controller Scenario
  Scenario: Remove an Evaluation from a Student                                                                                                              # RemoveEvaluation.feature:17
    Given the system has a student registered with name "Fulano Detal" and login "fd"                                                                        # RemoveEvaluationSteps.groovy:94
    And this student has a "MA" evaluation in criterion "ESS" with origin "Test" and applicationDate "21/12/1992"                                            # RemoveEvaluationSteps.groovy:101
    When I remove the evaluation "MA" in criterion "ESS" with origin "Test" and applicationDate "21/12/1992" from the student "Fulano Detal" with login "fd" # RemoveEvaluationSteps.groovy:109
    Then the system correctly removes the evaluation                                                                                                         # RemoveEvaluationSteps.groovy:135
